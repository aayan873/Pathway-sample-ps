# Bitcoin Price Prediction with LSTM

Real time directional Bitcoin price prediction using a two-layer LSTM with technical indicators.

## Overview

This project predicts Bitcoin price movements (up/down) using historical price data and technical indicators. The model achieves **54.68% directional accuracy** on test data through a probability-weighted expected return methodology.

## Details

- **Two-Layer LSTM Architecture:** 64→32 hidden units with dropout regularization
- **Technical Indicators:** MA5, MA10, MA20, RSI14, 10-day volatility, price range, returns
- **Zero Data Leakage:** Strict temporal ordering prevents future information leakage
- **Binary Classification:** Predicts probability of upward/downward price movement
- **PyTorch Implementation:** CUDA-accelerated training when GPU available

## Dataset

The model uses Bitcoin historical price data:
- **Training:** November 19, 2013 – December 31, 2024
- **Testing:** January 1, 2025 – October 21, 2025
- **Features:** open, high, low, close, volume, marketCap

Data files: 
- `Bitcoin_19_11_2013-31_12_2024_train_data.csv`
- `Bitcoin_01_01_2025-21_10_2025_test_data.csv`

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

```python train.py```

**What happens:**
- Loads training data
- Engineers technical indicators (MA5, MA10, MA20, RSI14, volatility)
- Creates 30-day sequences
- Trains LSTM for 50 epochs with batch size 128
- Saves model to `lstm_model.pth` and scaler to `scaler.pkl`


### 2. Testing and Prediction

```python test.py```

**What happens:**
- Loads trained model and scaler
- Generates predictions on test data
- Calculates directional accuracy
- Displays predicted vs actual price plot
- Shows directional accuracy: **54.68%**

## Feature Engineering

The model uses 9 engineered features:

1. **Close Price:** Current closing price
2. **Volume:** Trading volume
3. **Range:** Daily price range (current close - previous close)
4. **Returns:** Percentage change in price
5. **MA5:** 5-day moving average
6. **MA10:** 10-day moving average
7. **MA20:** 20-day moving average
8. **Volatility10:** 10-day rolling standard deviation of returns
9. **RSI14:** 14-day Relative Strength Index

## Prediction Methodology

The model uses **probability-weighted expected return** to convert binary classification outputs to price predictions:

1. Model outputs probability `p` of upward movement
2. Expected return calculated as: `E[R] = p × μ_pos + (1-p) × μ_neg`
   - μ_pos = mean positive return from training data
   - μ_neg = mean negative return from training data
3. Next price predicted as: `Predicted Close = Current Close × (1 + E[R])`

This methodology follows standard financial forecasting practices for probability-weighted returns.

## Results

- **Directional Accuracy:** 54.68%
- **Model captures major trend movements**
- **Maintains temporal integrity** (no future data leakage)

## Technical Details

**Data Preprocessing:**
- StandardScaler normalization applied to all features
- Sliding window of 30 days creates sequences
- Train-test split maintains chronological order

**Model Training:**
- Reproducible results (seed=42 for all random components)
- GPU acceleration when available (`cuda` device detection)
- Progress tracking with tqdm
- Model and scaler persistence for inference
